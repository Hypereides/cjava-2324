# Computer Science Weekly Workshop Projects Showcase

Welcome to the Computer Science Weekly Workshop Projects Showcase repository! This project is a compilation of examples from my computer science weekly workshop projects, where I aim to provide functioning code samples in C. The goal is to offer a valuable resource for anyone looking to enhance their understanding of C programming.

## Overview

In this repository, you will find a collection of well-commented and organized C code snippets. Each example corresponds to a specific concept or challenge encountered during my computer science weekly workshops. The primary purpose is to serve as a reference and learning tool for individuals interested in gaining a better grasp of coding in C.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the repository and delve into the code examples. You can use these samples to:

- **Learn C Programming:** Understand various C programming concepts through practical examples.
- **Improve Coding Skills:** Enhance your coding skills by studying and modifying the provided code.
- **Prepare for Interviews:** Use these examples to prepare for C-related technical interviews.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Hypereides/cjava-2324.git
    ```

2. Explore the code examples in the `src` directory.

3. Each example is accompanied by comments explaining the purpose and functionality of the code. Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding.

## Contribution

If you'd like to contribute to this project by adding more examples, improving documentation, or fixing bugs, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.

2. Create a new branch:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/new-example
    ```

3. Make your changes and commit them:

    ```bash
    git commit -am 'Add new example: <example-name>'
    ```

4. Push to the branch:

    ```bash
    git push origin feature/new-example
    ```

5. Create a pull request.

## Feedback

I appreciate any feedback, suggestions, or bug reports you may have. Feel free to open an issue or reach out to me directly.
