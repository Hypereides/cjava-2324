# C and Java Weekly Workshop Projects Showcase

Welcome to the C and Java Weekly Workshop Projects Showcase repository! This project is a compilation of examples from my computer science weekly workshop projects, featuring both C and Java programming languages. The goal is to provide functioning code samples to serve as a valuable resource for anyone looking to enhance their understanding of C and Java programming.

## Overview

In this repository, you will find a collection of well-commented and organized C and Java code snippets. Each example corresponds to a specific concept or challenge encountered during my computer science weekly workshops. The primary purpose is to serve as a reference and learning tool for individuals interested in gaining a better grasp of coding in C and Java.

## How to Use
